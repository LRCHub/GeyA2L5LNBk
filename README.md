[00:00.51] Running off over next door's garden before the hour is done
[00:03.83] It's more a question of feeling than it is a question of fun
[00:07.37] The confidence is the balaclava, I'm sure you'll baffle 'em good
[00:11.05] Will the ending reek of salty cheeks and runny makeup alone?
[00:41.05] 
[00:14.32] Or will blood run down the face of a boy bewildered and scorned?
[00:17.32] And you'll find yourself in a skirmish where you wish you'd never been born?
[00:20.48] You tie yourself to the tracks and there isn't no going back
[00:23.79] And it's wrong, wrong, wrong, but we'll do it anyway 'cause we love a bit of trouble
[01:05.79] 
[00:41.90] Are you pulling her from a burning building or throwing her to the sharks?
[00:44.93] Can only hope that the ending is as pleasurable as the start
[00:48.16] The confidence is the balaclava, I'm sure you'll baffle 'em straight
[00:51.26] And it's wrong, wrong, wrong, but she can hardly wait
[01:17.76] 
[00:54.79] That's right, he won't let her out his sight
[01:00.32] Now the shaggers perform and the daggers are drawn
[01:04.08] Who's the crooks in this crime?
[01:07.78] That's right, he won't let her out his sight
[01:14.46] Now the shaggers perform and the daggers are drawn
[01:18.23] Who's the crooks in this crime?
[01:33.73] 
[01:46.13] That's right, he won't let her out his sight
[01:52.64] That's right, he won't let her out his sight
[01:59.27] That's right, he won't let her out his sight
[02:04.85] Well, you'll be able to boast of the day of the most flawless heist of all time
[02:44.35] 
[02:18.59] You knew that it'd be trouble right before the very first kiss
[02:22.28] Quiet and unassuming, but you heard that they were the naughtiest
[02:26.14] She pleaded with you to take it off but you resisted and fought
[02:29.16] But sorry, sweetheart, I'd much rather keep on the balaclava
